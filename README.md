# RareSkills Gas Puzzles - Optimized

## Non-Optimized Contract Gas
- Require (43 392 gas)
- ArraySum (23 399 gas)
 

## Optimized Contract Gas (All Attempts)
- Require 1 (26 292 gas)
- Require 2 (26 282 gas)
- Require 3 (26 226 gas)
- ArraySum 1 ( gas)



Rules
- you may not change the optimizer level
- you may not change the solidity version
- you may refactor functionality as long as you don't break the business logic
- you may make reasonable assumptions about what variable sizes are necessary to get things done
- you may remove unnecessary or redunant logic (some have been intentionally added)
- because making functions `payable` is a controversial optimization, you do not need to make functions `payable` to reach the gas target unless the function needs to be payable to fulfill its business logic
